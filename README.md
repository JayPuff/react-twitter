# react-twitter
Converting the simple twitter log in stuff I did for Esports check into react (Practice plus integrating with ajax/api)


# What I have to do when making a react project

## Setup

1. get node and npm
1. get create-react-app with npm
1. create a project directory using ^

## After Setup

1. Style root/body/html in index.css!
1. Go to package.json and add "homepage" attribute and then host directory path so that it works in build version! ("Z:/...")
1. Removing that register service worker thing that works only on build version because idk what it does.
1. Create Folder structure that I'm using so far: assets, components, containers
1. Anything in public folder will be in ported to the root of /build! Ex: Font-awesome folder
1. For google fonts I simply changed the index.html template and added the link tag? Is importing through css better?
